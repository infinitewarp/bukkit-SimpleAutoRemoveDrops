SimpleAutoRemoveDrops
=====================

Simple bukkit plugin for removing all item drops and projectiles once a limit has been reached.

Minecraft can become slow or unresponsive when many entities are present in a world. An unmanageable number of drops could exist following large explosions or automatic harvesting of large farms, for example. To keep the server healthy and the players happy, SimpleAutoRemoveDrops should be used to cull excess drops and projectiles following these kinds of events.
